# 👤 Day 13 – User Management REST API

This project is part of the **14-Day Back-End Web Development Learning Plan**.  
It is a simple **User Management API** built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.

The API allows users to perform basic CRUD operations:
- Create a user
- Retrieve all users or by ID
- Update a user
- Delete a user

Tested using **Thunder Client** (a REST client extension for VS Code).
